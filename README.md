# MPMB-UA23PT6-Content
This script adds the content from the "Unearthed Arcana 2023: Player's Handbook Playtest 6" article to the MPMB character sheet.

More specifically, this script adds the following:
- UA23PT6 Cleric & its subclasses
- UA23PT6 Paladin & its subclasses
- UA23PT6 Ranger & its subclasses
- UA23PT6 Rogue & its subclasses
- UA23PT6 spells
- CompanionList menu option for the UA23PT6 "Find Steed" spell
- CreatureList entries of the "Otherworldly Steed" creature for each spell level
- The "Otherworldly Steed" creature's "Otherworldly Slam" attack
- CompanionList menu option for the Beast Master Ranger's Primal Beasts
- CreatureList entries for each of the Beast Master Ranger's Primal Beasts
- The "Beast of the Sea" creature's "Binding Strike" attack
- Six Fighting Style Feats

This encompasses all of the content in this UA article that wasn't superseded or removed in later content.

# This script DOES NOT add the Bard class that appeared in this UA article because the Arcane, Divine, and Primal Spell Lists have been removed from playtesting & the Bard in this UA article depends on those Spell Lists to function correctly.
Please find the UA22XC Bard script for a working UA Bard class and subclasses; link here: (Still in development; link will be here once it is complete)

This script will allow users to more easily playtest the upcoming revision to D&D 5E.
